.SH DESCRIPTION
h5import converts data from one or more ASCII or binary files, infile, into the same number of HDF5 datasets in the existing or new HDF5 file, outfile. Data conversion is performed in accordance with the user-specified type and storage properties specified in in_options.
.PP
The primary objective of h5import is to import floating point or integer data. The utility's design allows for future versions that accept ASCII text files and store the contents as a compact array of one-dimensional strings, but that capability is not implemented in HDF5 Release 1.6.
.PP
.B "Input data and options"
.PP
Input data can be provided in one of the follwing forms:
.IP *
As an ASCII, or plain-text, file containing either floating point or integer data
.IP *
As a binary file containing either 32-bit or 64-bit native floating point data
.IP *
As a binary file containing native integer data, signed or unsigned and 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit.
.IP *
As an ASCII, or plain-text, file containing text data. (This feature is not implemented in HDF5 Release 1.6.) 
.PP
Each input file, infile, contains a single n-dimensional array of values of one of the above types expressed in the order of fastest-changing dimensions first.
.PP
Floating point data in an ASCII input file must be expressed in the fixed floating form (e.g., 323.56) h5import is designed to accept scientific notation (e.g., 3.23E+02) in an ASCII, but that is not implemented in HDF5 release 1.6.
.PP
Each input file can be associated with options specifying the datatype and storage properties. These options can be specified either as command line arguments or in a configuration file. Note that exactly one of these approaches must be used with a single input file.
.PP
Command line arguments, best used with simple input files, can be used to specify the class, size, dimensions of the input data and a path identifying the output dataset.
.PP
The recommended means of specifying input data options is in a configuration file; this is also the only means of specifying advanced storage features. See further discussion in "The configuration file" below.
.PP
The only required option for input data is dimension sizes; defaults are available for all others.
.PP
h5import will accept up to 30 input files in a single call. Other considerations, such as the maximum length of a command line, may impose a more stringent limitation.
.PP
.B "Output data and options:"
.PP
The name of the output file is specified following the -o or -output option in outfile. The data from each input file is stored as a separate dataset in this output file. outfile may be an existing file. If it does not yet exist, h5import will create it.
.PP
Output dataset information and storage properties can be specified only by means of a configuration file.
.TP
.B Dataset path
If the groups in the path leading to the dataset do not exist, h5import will create them.  If no group is specified, the dataset will be created as a member of the root group.  If no dataset name is specified, the default name is dataset1 for the first input dataset, dataset2 for the second input dataset, dataset3 for the third input dataset, etc.  h5import does not overwrite a pre-existing dataset of the specified or default name. When an existing dataset of a confilcting name is encountered, h5import quits with an error; the current input file and any subsequent input files are not processed.
.TP
.B Output type 	
Datatype parameters for output data
.TP
.B
Output data class
Signed or unsigned integer or floating point
.TP
.B Output data size
8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit integer 32- or 64-bit floating point
.TP
.B Output architecture 	
IEEE, STD, NATIVE (Default), Other architectures are included in the h5import design but are not implemented in this release.
.TP
.B Output byte order 
Little- or big-endian.  Relevant only if output architecture is IEEE, UNIX, or STD; fixed for other architectures.
.TP
.B Dataset layout and storage properties
Denote how raw data is to be organized on the disk. If none of the following are specified, the default configuration is contiguous layout and with no compression.
.TP
.B Layout
Contiguous (Default),  Chunked
.TP
.B External storage
Allows raw data to be stored in a non-HDF5 file or in an external HDF5 file. Requires contiguous layout.
.TP
.B Compressed
Sets the type of compression and the level to which the dataset must be compressed. Requires chunked layout.
.TP
.B Extendible
Allows the dimensions of the dataset increase over time and/or to be unlimited. Requires chunked layout.
.TP
.B Compressed and extendible 
Requires chunked layout.
.SH FILES
A configuration file is specified with the \-c config_file option:
.RS
h5import infile \-c config_file [infile -\c config_file2 ...] \-outfile outfile
.RE
.PP
The configuration file is an ASCII file and must be organized as "Configuration_Keyword Value" pairs, with one pair on each line. For example, the line indicating that the input data class (configuration keyword INPUT-CLASS) is floating point in a text file (value TEXTFP) would appear as follows:
.RS
INPUT-CLASS TEXTFP
.RE
.PP
A configuration file may have the following keywords each followed by one of the following defined values. One entry for each of the first two keywords, RANK and DIMENSION-SIZES, is required; all other keywords are optional.
.PP
.TP
.B "RANK rank"
An integer specifying the number of dimensions in the dataset.
Example:   RANK 4   for a 4-dimensional dataset.
.TP
.B "DIMENSION-SIZES dim_sizes"
Sizes of the dataset dimensions. (Required)
A string of space-separated integers specifying the sizes of the dimensions in the dataset. The number of sizes in this entry must match the value in the RANK entry. The fastest-changing dimension must be listed first.
Example:   DIMENSION_SIZES 4 3 4 38   for a 38x4x3x4 dataset.
.TP
.B "PATH path"
Path of the output dataset.
The full HDF5 pathname identifying the output dataset relative to the root group within the output file. I.e., path is a string consisting of optional group names, each followed by a slash, and ending with a dataset name. If the groups in the path do no exist, they will be created. If PATH is not specified, the output dataset is stored as a member of the root group and the default dataset name is dataset1 for the first input dataset, dataset2 for the second input dataset, dataset3 for the third input dataset, etc.  Note that h5import does not overwrite a pre-existing dataset of the specified or default name. When an existing dataset of a confilcting name is encountered, h5import quits with an error; the current input file and any subsequent input files are not processed.
Example: The configuration file entry "PATH grp1/grp2/dataset1" indicates that the output dataset dataset1 will be written in the group grp2/ which is in the group grp1/, a member of the root group in the output file.

.SH NOTES
If the -c config_file option is used with an input file, no other argument can be used with that input file. If the -c config_file option is not used with an input data file, the -d dim_list argument (or -dims dim_list) must be used and any combination of the remaining options may be used. Any arguments used must appear in exactly the order used in the syntax declarations immediately above.
.PP
Note that while only the -dims argument is required, arguments must used in the order in which they are listed below.
