Description: Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) - runtime files - serial version
 HDF5 is a file format and library for storing scientific data. 
 HDF5 was designed and implemented to address the deficiencies of
 HDF4.x. It has a more powerful and flexible data model, supports
 files larger than 2 GB, and supports parallel I/O.
 .
 This package contains runtime files for serial platforms.
